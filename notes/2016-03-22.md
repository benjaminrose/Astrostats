# Section 3.6 -- Correlation Coefficients

* Why CC? -- How related are two variables -- is this a bivariate distribution?
* [Student T test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) -- estimates the mean of a small sampled, normal-distribution, unknown std data set.
* Nonparametric correlations -- uses ranking of the data
* Person-r -- has some issues: does not account for errors, terrible if there are outliers.

# Section 3.7

* `scipy.stats.distributions` has awesome methods including `rvs`. 
* `numpy.random` and `random.random` use a highly tested psuedo-random number generator.
* ?? How you you get a generator to choose from 0 ≤ x ≤ 1? `np.random.rand()` is `[0,1)`.
* It is easy to take a uniform distribution and convert it to a data defined distribution via interpretation (use a spline fit) of the inverted CDF.
* Multivariate is hard unless it is separable, or a Gaussian (but that is really just separable along the principle axes.)
