#2016-02-23 Astro Statistics: Sections 3.1, 3.2

Attendance: Prof. Phillips, Aparna Bhattacharya, Geoffrey Lentner, Vini Placco, Devin Whitten, Jason Wiggins, Christopher Wotta

We had some difficulty with Bayes' Rule. Specifically, knowing when to apply it. Prof. Phillips has a couple of books that give examples of applying Bayes' Theorem.

We discussed the Monty Hall problem from a perspective of Bayes' Theorem. It's still confusing.

We will read Sections 3.3 and 3.4 for next week.
