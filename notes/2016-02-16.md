#2016-02-16 Astro Statistics: Chapter 1

Attendance: Vini Placco, Jonathan Crass, Jason Wiggins, Devin Whitten, Geoffrey Lentner, Christopher Wotta, Ben Rose

What do we want to get out of this class?

- Statistics: Which test to use and when

We'll skip Chapter 2 and start with Chapter 3 next week

We think we want this to be implementation-agnostic (programming language-agnostic)


Roadmap:

1. Gather a dataset into a CSV file to work with, and host it on GitHub
2. Read Chapter 3.1--3.2.
